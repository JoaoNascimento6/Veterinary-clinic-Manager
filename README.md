# Veterinary Clinic Manager ![c-sharp (2)](https://github.com/JoaoNascimento6/Veterinary-clinic-Manager/assets/120685146/8d6bb1c5-13ab-478e-bcd0-0e96b60516d3)

> A Windows Forms application for managing veterinary clinic interventions using C# and .NET.

## Project Description 

A veterinary clinic has contacted you to develop an application for managing the interventions performed by the clinic. The application should allow storing data for veterinarians, animals, their owners, and the interventions carried out. It should support scheduling different types of interventions, such as consultations, vaccinations, or surgeries. Each intervention must consider the veterinarian, the type of animal (dog, cat, or other), and the type of intervention. The costs of interventions vary based on the type of animal, the weight of the animal, and the type of intervention.

In summary, creating the Veterinary Clinic Manager in C# and .NET has taught me practical skills in object-oriented programming, user interface design, and data management. It was an opportunity to apply OOP principles, understand user interactions, and handle data effectively. The project emphasized problem-solving, collaboration, and continuous learning, enhancing my abilities as a developer.
